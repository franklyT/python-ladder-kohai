            A checkerboard, aside from its eponymous usage (to play the game checkers!), is a commonly 
            expressed pattern consisting of alternating squares (usually white and black), laid out 
            in a 2-dimensional grid - a pattern we can express in terms of "rows" and "columns".
            <br /><br />
            Define a function checkerboard that takes two arguments, an integer representing "rows" 
            and "columns" respectively.
            <br /> <br />
            This function should return a checkerboard of the appropriate size (e.g. 8 rows 
            by 8 columns), with a unique character to represent each alternating color square.
            <br /> <br />
            Note: Python secretly appends a newline character ("\\n") to each print statement.
            To override this behavior, provide a second argument to a print statement (named end),
            and set its value to an empty string. By default, this second argument, as you might 
            expect, has a "\\n" value.
