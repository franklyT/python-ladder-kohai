            <p>
              The <s c|def>range</s> function in Python is a profoundly common operation, such that we've 
              probably already used it multiple times in our lessons thus far. As a result, 
              Python providing us with a built-in definition for <s c|def>range</s> is hugely useful.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast, a language like JavaScript actually has no definition for <s c|def>range</s> in its 
              "standard library". Those who would like to take advantage of this powerful function 
              must either import a third-party library with this functionality, or write their own 
              code.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is that to define a range function is actually a fairly trivial endeavor!
              As such, we're going to prove it by re-writing a basic <s c|def>range</s> function in Python.
              You don't need to include the step parameter, which increments a range by a specified 
              amount instead of just <s c|num>1</s>, but if you would like, you can!
            </p>
            <p>
              Define a function, <s c|def>custom_range</s>, that takes two arguments, <s c|code-block>min:</s> <s c|type>int</s> and <s c|code-block>max:</s> <s c|type>int</s>, that prints out
              a <s c|def>range</s>, expressed in a list, between the given <s c|code-block>min</s> and <s c|code-block>max</s> arguments.
