            If asked, someone with two siblings would trivially be able to tell you if they were the 
            "middle" sibling. Of three, there is one sibling definitively in the middle.
            <br /> <br />
            Define a function get_middle that takes one argument, str as a string, and returns the 
            middle character. Remember, this is an operation that is only technically completely 
            trivial in one case. If your function cannot find a "middle" character in a given string, 
            print the middle two characters.
