            <p>
              The idea of "flipping a coin" has long represented, in American cultural parlance, a 50/50 
              chance. In reality, flipping an American quarter is only pretty close to 50/50, not actually 50/50!
            </p>
            <p>
              For our purposes, however, let's assume that flipping a coin represents an exactly 50/50 chance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Given this, first define a function <sdef|flip_coin|ss> that takes <scb|num_flips:|ss> <styp|int|ss> as an argument.
              <sdef|num_flips|ss>, "flip a coin", so to speak, by producing a mathematical statement with a 50% 
              chance to represent one of two numbers (the <sdef|Math|ss> object might help!). Assign a counter for 
              each possibility, incrementing our coin, "heads" or "tails", depending on the outcome.
              Print out our heads and tails tallies for n. Your outcome should be pretty close to 50/50.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, let's prove it! If you want to pass this exercise, print out a probability estimate 
              for each counter. For our purposes, probability can be expressed as number of heads or tails 
              divided by total flips. Use the round function to round to the nearest <snum|1|ss> digit, and multiply it 
              by <snum|100|ss> to get the probability expressed as a percentage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't be afraid to use hints if you're stuck at any point! Break this exercise down, step-by-step, 
              to easily solve it. While it may sound complex in summation, each step is quite trivial. Do not 
              attempt to produce a final program without first slowly working your way there, by producing an 
              "almost" program!
