            The range function in Python is a profoundly common operation, such that we've 
            probably already used it multiple times in our lessons thus far. As a result, 
            Python providing us with a built-in definition for range is hugely useful.
            <br /> <br />
            In contrast, a language like JavaScript actually has no definition for range in its 
            "standard library". Those who would like to take advantage of this powerful function 
            must either import a third-party library with this functionality, or write their own 
            code.
            <br /> <br />
            The good news is that to define a range function is actually a fairly trivial endeavor!
            As such, we're going to prove it by re-writing a basic range function in Python.
            You don't need to include the step parameter, which increments a range by a specified 
            amount instead of just 1, but if you would like, you can!
            <br /> <br />
            Define a function, custom_range, that takes two arguments, min and max, that prints out
            a range, expressed in a list, between the given min and max arguments.
