            You probably know, by now, how to 
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/for-loops-in-python/">iterate through a list</a> 
            (or <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/mutable-vs-immutable-objects-python/#immutable-objects-in-python">tuple!</a>). 
            <br /> <br />In this exercise, you will accomplish
            a similar task: define a function <span class="def">count_chars</span> that takes two arguments, 
            the first argument being a string to be checked, and the second argument being a character,
            (for example, <span class="string">'b'</span>), which we will represent the character
            we will be counting in the string. For example, <span class="code-block"><span class="def">count_chars</span>(<span class="string">'ABC'</span>, <span class="string">'A'</span>)</span> will print
            <span class="number">1</span>, as only one instance of the character <span class="string">'A'</span> appears
            in our string.
            <br /><br />
            Iterate through the string and print the resultant characters to the console.
